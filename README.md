# This is the README for **BACON LAND**

## What's going on?
This is a pretty simple webpage with some placeholder images and  a few columns   
of ipsums related to bacon .

## What's under the hood?
For my project I decided to use an interactive image carousel, some Bootstrap  
to ensure a mobile first design, and a form if you would like to sign up for a   
newsletter about Bacon events around the country. I even worked in a sticky  
footer for the copyright!

The project is very simple (K.I.S.S.), and as such should run without  
any outside materials needed beyond a browser.
