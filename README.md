# This is the README for **BACON LAND**

## What's going on?
This is a pretty simple webpage with some placeholder images and  a few columns   
of ipsums related to bacon .

## What's under the hood?
1) An iteractive image carousel.  
2) Some Bootstrap to ensure a mobile first design, that also enabled a flexbox  
to arrange the columns for normal screen size break points.  
3) A form if you would like to sign up for a newsletter.  
4) I even worked in a sticky footer for the copyright!

The project is very simple (K.I.S.S.), and as such should run without  
any outside materials needed beyond a browser.  

I am currently learning to break the gutters on my bootstrap, so that  
it doesn't hug the left side when it is viewed on mobile screens.
